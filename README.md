An Android app that allows the user to play the game PigDice against a CPU.

About Pig Dice: The player who goes first will be radnomly decied. That first player will then roll a single die. If they roll a 2,3,4,5, or 6 then that number will be added
to the total number of points scored that round and the player gets to decide if they want to roll again or bank their points and pass the die to the other player. If they roll again and
get's a number other than 1 than that number is again added to the total points for that round. However, if they roll a 1, they lose all the points they accumalted during
that round. That player's turn is over and they must pass the die to the other player. At any point in a round a player can chose to bank the points earned that round
to their total score and end their turn. This continues until a player's score reaches the pre-determined amount.
